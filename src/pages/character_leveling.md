## Earning Experience
GMs will decide how much XP characters earn after each session based on what the characters accomplish. Ideally, characters should be able to level something up almost every session (at least at the beginning, while costs are low), but should not be able to do too much leveling between sessions. A threshold of 10-20XP might make sense based on the types of encounters players have in a session.

Increasing skills and attributes should not happen arbitrarily. They should reflect the experiences the character has. If you start with a rank 2 in strength, but don’t do anything in game play that could feasibly improve that strength score, it shouldn’t be leveled up. Conversely, if you’ve been doing a lot of hacking, you’re probably getting better at it, and so might choose to level up your cybernetics skill once you have enough points to do so.

No single thing from the below list may be leveled up more than once per session and only at the end of the session. 

## Allocating Experience
- **Health** 
  - Each character starts with 10 \+ rank in Health hit points. To increase hit points, players can spend 10XP to add their rank in health in additional hit points. 
  - **Example:** A character with a rank 3 in health would spend 10XP to add 3HP to their total
- **Attributes**
  - To level up an attribute, multiply the new rank x 10 in XP 
  - **Example:** Leveling up Magic from 3 to 4 would cost 40XP
- **Skills**
  -To level up an existing skill, multiply the new rank x 5 in XP 
  - **Example:** Leveling up Force from a 2 to 3 costs 15XP
- **New Skills**
  -  Allocating XP to a skill the player is not proficient in and has no ranks in costs 10XP to acquire the first level, instead of 5, and should narratively make sense based on types of things the character has done. Once the new skill is acquired, additional leveling costs the same as existing skills. 
- **Expertise**
  -  The first expertise in a background tree is free at character creation. Leveling in the Expertise tree, however, costs XP. The top row of the tree (level 1) costs 10XP each to acquire. 
  - The second row (level 2) costs 20XP. 
  - The third row (level 3) costs 30XP. 
  - **Note:** The progression through the tree also needs to be sequential (you cannot jump from level 1 to level 3 in an expertise). The unique starting background expertise is in the top left corner of this tree. The first level in the second column expertise also needs to be purchased before the first level in the third column expertise. But higher levels do not need to follow the same column progression so long as level one is acquired. 
    - **Example:** 
      ```
      1.1 ->  1.2 ->  1.3     
        v        v      v
      2.1     2.2     2.3
        v        v      v
      3.1     3.2     3.3
      ```
